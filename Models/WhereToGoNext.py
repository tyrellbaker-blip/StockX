#TODO: Build a function to calculate purchase date/ release date difference?
#   In our function, we would first compare the year as an int, then month as
#   an int, then day as an int, unless there is already a function to compare
#   dates

#TODO: Total value of shoes sold over their retail value?

#TODO: How long after the release date was the shoe sold?
#   Along with this, we can also see how often they were sold, or in other words,
#   what was the time period between each sell?

#TODO: What are the most and least popular shoes within each category? If
#   we can figure this out, we can figure out which values to exclude from our
#   model
